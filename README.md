0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O


Requirements
General

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.

  * [103-merge_sort.c](./103-merge_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the 'top-down' Merge Sort algorithm.
    * When an array is divided, the size of the left subarray is always less than or equal to the size of the right subarray.
    * Always sorts the left subarray before the right one.
  * Prints subarrays each time they are merged.
  * [103-O](./103-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexities of the Merge Sort algorithm, one per line.

* **8. Heap sort**
  * [104-heap_sort.c](./104-heap_sort.c): C function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Heap Sort algorithm.
  * Implements the 'sift-down' Heap Sort algorithm.
  * Prints the array after each swap.
  * [104-O](./104-O): Text file containing the best, average, and worst case time complexiites of the Heap Sort algorithm, one per line.
